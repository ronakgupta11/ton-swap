# Set Swap Components

This directory contains the modular components for the swap configuration page, broken down from the original monolithic component for better maintainability and reusability.

## Components

### NavigationHeader
- Handles the top navigation bar with back button and Ultron Swap logo
- Self-contained navigation component

### ProgressSteps
- Displays the current step in the swap process
- Shows "Connected" and "Set Swap" progress indicators

### SwapInterface
- Main swap input interface with from/to token selection
- **Functional Features:**
  - Input validation and real-time calculation
  - Token selection dropdowns
  - Swap direction toggle
  - Automatic amount calculation based on input

### AdvancedSettings
- Configuration panel for advanced swap parameters
- **Functional Features:**
  - Max Slippage slider (0.1% - 5.0%)
  - TWAP Duration slider (5 min - 4 hours)
  - Number of Slices slider (2 - 20)
  - Real-time value updates

### AISuggestions
- AI-powered recommendations panel
- **Dynamic Features:**
  - Calculates expected slippage based on current settings
  - Estimates fees based on number of slices
  - Shows market analysis and network status
  - Updates recommendations when settings change

### ExecutionSummary
- Quick stats display for the current swap configuration
- **Dynamic Features:**
  - Shows total amount and expected output
  - Displays duration and slice breakdown
  - Updates automatically when parameters change

## State Management

The main page (`app/set-swap/page.tsx`) manages all state and passes it down to components via props:

- `fromAmount` / `toAmount`: Input amounts with real-time calculation
- `fromToken` / `toToken`: Selected tokens with swap functionality
- `slippage` / `duration` / `slices`: Advanced settings with slider controls

## Usage

All components are exported from the index file and can be imported as:

```tsx
import { 
  NavigationHeader, 
  ProgressSteps, 
  SwapInterface, 
  AdvancedSettings, 
  AISuggestions, 
  ExecutionSummary 
} from "@/components/set-swap"
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be used independently
3. **Functionality**: All input fields and sliders are now fully functional
4. **State Management**: Centralized state with proper prop drilling
5. **Type Safety**: All components have proper TypeScript interfaces
6. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual components without affecting others
